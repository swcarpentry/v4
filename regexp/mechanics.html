    <p class="media-body">Hello, and welcome to the third episode of the Software Carpentry lecture on regular expressions.  In this episode, we'll take a look at the mechanics of regular expressions, i.e., what the computer actually does when it's matching a regular expression against a piece of text.  You don't need to know this in order to do a lot with regular expressions, but if you are composing or debugging complex REs, it helps to understand what's going on behind the scenes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/002.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If you recall, we have some notebooks with recordings of background evil levels in millivaders, taken in the Shire a couple of years after the Death Star exploded.  The data in these notebooks is in different formats&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/003.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and we're using regular expressions to parse them.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/004.png" />
    <p class="media-body">In the last episode, one of the regular expressions we came up with was this complicated beast: <code>'(.+)/([A-Z][a-z]+) ([0-9]{1,2}),? ([0-9]{4})/(.+)'</code> It matches one or more characters followed by a literal slash '/', followed by a single upper-case character and one or more lower-case characters, followed by a space, then one or two digits, an optional comma, another space, exactly four digits, another literal slash, and one or more characters at the end.  That's a pretty complex match, and you might be asking yourself&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/005.png" />
    <p class="media-body">How does it do it?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/006.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The answer is that regular expressions are implemented using <em>finite state machines</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/007.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Here's a very simple finite state machine that matches exactly, and only, the single character "lower case a".</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/008.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We start matching with the incoming arrow on the left.  It takes us to the first state in our finite state machine.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/009.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The only way to get from there to the second state is to match exactly one character, because the arc between state 1 and state 2 is labelled with the character 'a'.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/010.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The second state is marked with a dot in the middle, which means it's an end state.  We must be in one of these states at the end of our match in order for the match to be valid.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/011.png" />
    <p class="media-body">So now we have a finite state machine that matches the very simple regular expression 'a'.  Let's see if we can do something a little more interesting.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/012.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Here's a finite state machine that matches one 'a' followed by zero or more 'a's.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/013.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The first 'a' gets us from an initial state to an end state.  But we don't have to stop there: the curved arc at the top allows us to match another 'a', and brings us back to the same state.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/014.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We can then match another 'a', and another 'a', and so on indefinitely.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/015.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Note that we don't have to stop in the end state the first time we reach it: we just have to be in an end state when we run out of input.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/016.png" />
    <p class="media-body">What is the pattern?  It's 'a+': one 'a', followed by zero or more other 'a's, is the same as one or more 'a's.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/017.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Here's a finite state machine that matches against the letter 'a' or nothing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/018.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The top arc isn't marked, so that transition is free.  We can go from the first state to the second state without consuming any of our input.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/019.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This is "a or nothing"&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/020.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;which is the same as 'a?', i.e., the optional character 'a'.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/021.png" />
    <p class="media-body">So now we have three patterns in our library.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/022.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This regular expression looks like the one that matches one or more 'a's&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/023.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;except there's an extra arc to get us from the first state to the second without consuming any input.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/024.png" />
    <p class="media-body">So this will match 'a*', i.e., nothing at all (taking that free transition from the first state to the second) or one or more 'a's.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/025.png" />
    <p class="media-body">As you can see, we're building up a library of more and more complex patterns.  The tools we've seen so far are enough to implement most of the regular expressions we've encountered in the previous two episodes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/026.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Take a look, for example, at this finite state machine.  What is the corresponding regular expression?  We can either take the top route or the bottom.  The top route is 'a+'; the bottom route is a 'b', followed by either a 'c' or a 'd'.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/027.png" />
    <p class="media-body">So this is <code>'a+|(b(c|d))'</code>.  An input string that matches any of these paths will leave us in that final end state.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/028.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The most important thing about a finite state machine is that the action it takes at a node depends on only&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/029.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;the arcs out of that node&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/030.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and the characters in the target data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/031.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Finite state machines have no memory: they do <em>not</em> keep track of how they got into a state.  All decision-making is local to that state.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/032.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This means that there are many kinds of data that regular expressions <em>cannot</em> match.  For example, it is impossible to write a regular expression to check if nested parentheses match.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/033.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If you want to see whether '(((&hellip;)))' is balanced, you need some kind of memory&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/034.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;or at least a counter, and there isn't any memory in a finite state machine.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/035.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Similarly, if you want to check whether a word contains each vowel only once, the only way to do it is to write a regular expression with 120 clauses, because you need to check for each possible permutation of 'aeiou' independently.  You cannot write a regular expression that matches an arbitrary vowel, and then subtracts <em>that</em> vowel from the set of vowels yet to be matched, because once again, that would require some kind of memory, and finite state machines don't have any.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/036.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If regular expressions are limited this way, why do we use them?  There are two answers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/037.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The first is, they're really fast.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/038.png" />
    <p class="media-body">After you do some pre-calculation&mdash;essentially, after you compile the regular expression to create a finite state machine&mdash;a regular expression can be matched against input by looking at each input character only once.  That means the execution time only grows with the size of the data.  The time required for many other matching techniques grows much faster than the size of the input data.  So, while regular expressions are limited, the things they do, they do very, very well.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/039.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Also, regular expressions are readable.  Going back to our previous example, you might not think so,</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/040.png" />
    <p class="media-body">But imagine writing out a piece of code that matched that same input.  The regular expression is much easier to read, and probably much more efficient, than its procedural equivalent.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/041.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Regular expressions can do a lot more than the simple things we've seen so far.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="mechanics/042.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We'll explore their power in the next episode.</p>
